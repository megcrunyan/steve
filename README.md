# STEVE
Starting Training on Embedded Vehicle Engineering

Meet STEVE! My little robot car from the OSOYOO kit. Together, we're going to learn about embedded systems, sensor integration, real-time controls, and algorithms! 

## Getting Started
I'll be following the tutorials from this [robot car kit](https://osoyoo.com/2020/05/12/v2-1-robot-car-kit-for-arduino-tutorial-introduction/) but without using the sample code.

I'll be documenting my learning in the About section if you'd like to follow along. 

To use STEVE, you may download this zipped repository or use the following command `git clone https://github.com/megcrunyan/steve.git` 

## Roadmap
