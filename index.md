# STEVE
**Starting Training on Embedded Vehicle Engineering**

Meet STEVE! My little robot car from the OSOYOO kit. Together, we're going to learn about embedded systems, sensor integration, real-time controls, and autonomy! 

## Project Goals
 - Gain hands-on experience with Arduino and C++
 - Deepen understanding of Embedded Systems Architecture
 - Implement and tune common robotic behaviors
 - Develop an extensible framework for continued experimentation
   
I'll be following the tutorials from this [robot car kit](https://osoyoo.com/2020/05/12/v2-1-robot-car-kit-for-arduino-tutorial-introduction/) but writing all my own code without using the sample code.

You can follow along and see what I've learned in [Pages](https://megcrunyan.github.io/steve/) or fork the repo!
